Team Name: KA

Project Name: Flight Duration Optimizer

Proposal Link: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1s-Xu_c9M2oWjZY2OOAzQg4LZDP7QpA1WAo0ioLozLsg/edit

## Short Description:
This application would allow users to calculate the shortest flight duration between two airports. It is designed for travelers who want to find out the shortest possible travel time to get to another city regardless of other factors such as the ticket price, the total flight distance, and the convenience of departure/arrival time. Users can add/remove an airport, add/remove a flight, get the shortest travel duration between two airports and so on.
